## 🧠 About the Game

Experience three pivotal memories from a lifetime - a child's bedroom, a young adult's living room, and a wake for a beloved partner. As you solve puzzles in each room, objects begin to fade away, visually representing the deterioration of memory. The game loops endlessly, forcing players to confront the reality that some battles cannot be won.

**Core Concept:**
Memory health is represented diegetically through the environment itself. As time passes, less important objects fade from the rooms, leaving only the most meaningful items. This creates an increasingly focused puzzle experience while powerfully communicating the player character's cognitive decline without traditional health bars or UI elements.

**Key Features:**
- **Environmental Storytelling:** Each room tells a complete story through carefully placed objects and period-accurate details
- **Diegetic Health System:** Your "health" is the room itself - watch objects disappear as memory fades
- **Emotional Puzzle Design:** Puzzles reflect authentic moments from the character's life
- **Looping Narrative:** Discover the cyclical nature of memory loss through repeated gameplay
- **Era-Specific Design:** Three distinct time periods (1950s, 1960s-70s, modern day) with authentic aesthetics

## 🎯 The Three Memories

### Memory 1: The Childhood Bedroom (1950s)
A child's room in a humble home, filled with evidence of boredom and creative attempts at entertainment. Create a makeshift hand drum from mundane objects, leading to an emotional moment when loving parents gift their child a piano they saved for - despite their poverty.

**Puzzle Items:**
- Drinking glass (on dresser with radio)
- Wooden spoon (in cereal bowl on nightstand)
- Notebook paper (on desk)

### Memory 2: The Living Room (1960s-70s)
Years later, anxiously awaiting a college acceptance letter from your dream music school. Collect your Berklee College memorabilia before opening the letter, only to face crushing rejection - and the comfort of a supportive partner.

**Puzzle Items:**
- Berklee College shirt
- Berklee College hat
- Letter opener with college sigil
- The rejection letter

### Memory 3: The Wake (Modern Day)
The most painful memory - saying goodbye to your life partner. Prepare the wake by placing meaningful mementos before paying final respects, comforted by the presence of your grown child.

**Puzzle Items:**
- Portrait of the deceased
- Music box (gift from Memory 2)
- Partner's signature fedora

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**Central Design Problem:**
*"How can a designer diegetically use level geometry and architecture to show how close the player is to losing, while maximizing empathy between player and player character?"*

**Key Design Patterns Applied:**
- **Don't Intellectualize My Pain:** Health represented through fading objects, not abstract meters
- **Absolutely Absurd:** Environmental deterioration highlights the tragedy of memory loss
- **This Place Speaks to Me:** Every object tells part of the character's life story
- **It All Depends on How You Look At It:** First-person perspective maximizes emotional connection
- **Creating Comfort:** The first room never fades, allowing safe exploration and learning

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Engine:** Unity
- **Language:** C#
- **Development Course:** GAME 3400 (Game Design) at Northeastern University
- **Time Period:** Spring 2023

## 🎓 Academic Context

This game was created as a final project for GAME 3400, exploring how environmental design can communicate game state and evoke emotional responses. The project extensively utilized design patterns from *A Pattern Language for Game Design* and Christopher Alexander's architectural patterns.

**Development Focus:**
- Diegetic UI design and environmental storytelling
- Era-authentic art direction and prop design
- Emotional puzzle mechanics that serve narrative
- First-person perspective for maximizing player empathy
- Sound design for pacing and atmosphere

## 👥 Development Team

- **Rae Albus** - Environment design, props, lighting, sound implementation, UI systems
- **Brandon Lyman** - Game mechanics, level design, documentation
- **Jake Rosenfeld** - Living room design, props, furniture modeling
- **Austin Szema** - Wake scene design, character modeling, puzzle design
- **Arnold Yee** - Art assets, puzzle items, college memorabilia

## 📐 Level Design Highlights

Each room was meticulously designed with:
- Mood boards establishing emotion, color palette, and era-specific aesthetics
- Detailed floor plans and elevation plans for authentic spatial design
- Isometric concept art for precise object placement
- Greybox prototyping to test player flow and puzzle pacing
- Ranking system for object importance (determining fade order)

**Design Principles:**
- Two windows per room for natural lighting (Alexander's "Light on Two Sides")
- Strategic puzzle piece placement to encourage full room exploration
- Era-appropriate furniture, technology, and decorative elements
- Personal touches (height marks, calendars, family photos) to make spaces feel lived-in

## 🎵 Atmosphere

- Minimalist sound design emphasizing quiet contemplation
- Environmental audio cues for spatial awareness
- Era-appropriate music and sound effects
- Strategic use of silence to heighten emotional moments

## 🏆 The "Win" Condition

There is no traditional victory in Closing Moments. The only way to "win" is to accept the inevitable - to let the memories fade and find peace in the end. The game loops indefinitely until the player chooses to stop playing, mirroring the cyclical and ultimately unwinnable nature of cognitive decline.
